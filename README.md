nasin sitelen Kuwesi is a keyboard layout for writing toki pona in sitelen Lasina (latin script)

for the pink keys, the bottom right letter is used in the normal layout, while the top left is used in the [angle mod](https://colemakmods.github.io/ergonomic-mods/angle.html) version (which i recommend)

the name Kuwesi being just a tokiponization of qwerty may be a bit inconvenient. but it sounds cute! i guess if you need to differentiate you can use Kuwesi pona and Kuwesi ike

## why?
i was writing a lot of toki pona and realized traditional layouts aren't good for it, and making my own sounded fun

## how?
i based the layout on toki pona letter frequency. i placed vowels on one hand and consonants on the other to avoid single finger bygraphs. i also added common punctuation to the right hand for convenience. the layout was (briefly) tested by me, and analyzed  with [keyboard layout analyzer](https://patorjk.com/keyboard-layout-analyzer/v1/), which gave satisfactory results

## y?
intentional yupekosi

## how do i install it?
go to the folder for the system you're installing the layout on, download the ```kuwesi``` file and try to follow the ```instructions.md``` on said folder

## other stuff
- the layout may change if i find ways to improve it
- i will make a windows version if someone asks nicely
- there will be better instructions for installing the xkb version once i figure out how to do that on desktop environments.
no instructions for wms, if you use one of those you can figure it out
- contributions are welcome
