1. set up keyd and make it handle your keyboard layout. ```man keyd``` explains how to do this
2. move ```kuwesi``` somewhere inside ```/etc/keyd/```
3. include ```kuwesi``` in your keyd config
4. set up keybinds for switching to kuwesi and another layout (or just use kuwesi eternally?)

 the kuwesi file includes two layouts, ```kuwesi``` and ```kuwesi-anglemod```
