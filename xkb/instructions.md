1. move ```kuwesi``` to ```/usr/share/X11/xkb/symbols/```
2. set the ```kuwesi``` layout, optionally with the ```anglemod``` variant. how to do this will vary depending on your setup
3. optionally set the ```caps:backspace``` xkb option

these instructions aren't very specific, partially because the way to set this up varies a lot
