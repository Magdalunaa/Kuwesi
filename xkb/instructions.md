1. move ```kuwesi``` to ```/usr/share/X11/xkb/symbols/```
2. set the ```kuwesi``` layout, optionally choosing one of the variants. how to do this will vary depending on your setup
3. optionally set the ```caps:backspace``` xkb option

variants are ```anglemod```, ```altpunct```, and ```combined``` (angle mod + alt punctuation)

these instructions aren't very specific, partially because the way to set this up varies a lot
